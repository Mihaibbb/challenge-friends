<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed what may soon become a permanent digital transition in the domains of work, education, medicine, and leisure. This transition has also precipitated a spike in concern regarding our digital well-being. Prominent lobbying groups, such as the Center for Humane Technology (CHT), have responded to this concern. In April 2020, the CHT has offered a set of ‘Digital Well-Being Guidelines during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on DOING and LEARNING something AMAZING. We should stop wasting our lives on the internet!
* Internet is getting more and more repetitive, but ZELLENGE is constantly changing
* You should join our app and try a new challenge today :smile:

You can join today and create a challenge for someone, or, if you are brave enough complete a challenge and gain points. You can go up in rank and climb up the leaderboard, winning special prizes.
